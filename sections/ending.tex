\section{Summary}\label{sec:conclusion}

\lancet is the first system that can generate accurate, targeted, large-scale stress tests for programs. Though it builds upon dynamic symbolic execution, it sidesteps many of the fundamental scaling problems of such techniques through a novel use of statistical inference, allowing \lancet to generate large-scale test inputs without having to run large-scale dynamic symbolic execution. Through a series of case studies, we have demonstrated that \lancet is general, efficient and effective.
